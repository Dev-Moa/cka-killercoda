# Exercise 08 — Node Drain and Cordon

Drain a worker node for maintenance, then bring it back. This tests your understanding of pod eviction, DaemonSets, and scheduling.

## Tasks

1. List all nodes and identify a worker node
2. Cordon the worker node (mark it unschedulable)
3. Verify the node shows `SchedulingDisabled`
4. Create a Deployment with 3 replicas and observe where pods are scheduled
5. Drain the worker node — handle DaemonSets and local data
6. Verify all non-DaemonSet pods have been evicted from the node

## Hints

You honestly don't need hints for this one. `k drain --help` tells you everything. The two flags you always need are `--ignore-daemonsets` and `--delete-emptydir-data`.

</details>

## Verify

```bash
# After cordon
k get nodes
# Worker should show SchedulingDisabled

# After drain
k get pods -o wide
# No pods on the drained node (except DaemonSets)
```

When done, click **CHECK**.
