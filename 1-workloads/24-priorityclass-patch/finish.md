## What tripped me up

> I created the PriorityClass but forgot you need to set it on the Pod template spec, not the Deployment spec. The patch syntax is tricky. I also initially tried to edit the YAML file instead of using patch, which wastes time on the exam. The correct approach: create PriorityClass first, then patch the Deployment's pod template to add it.
>
> Also: I used a lower value (100) when the exam said "high priority." The scale is: system-cluster-critical (2000000000), system-node-critical (2000001000), user values usually 0-1000000. Going close to max (999999) ensures your pod gets scheduled first even under resource pressure.

```bash
k create ns exercise-24
kn exercise-24

# Create PriorityClass
k create priorityclass high-priority --value=999999 --description="Critical workload"

# Verify it was created
k get priorityclass high-priority

# Create deployment WITHOUT priorityClassName
k create deployment critical-app --image=busybox:1.36 --replicas=1 $do > deploy.yaml
# (image is sleep 3600 in original, but busybox defaults are fine)

k apply -f deploy.yaml

# Now patch the deployment to add priorityClassName
# Target: spec.template.spec.priorityClassName
k patch deployment critical-app -p '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"priorityClassName":"high-priority"}}}}'

# Verify patch was applied
k get deploy critical-app -o jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.priorityClassName}'
# Output: high-priority

# The pod will be recreated with the new priority class
k get pods -n exercise-24

# Verify pod has it
k get pod -n exercise-24 -o jsonpath='{.items[0].spec.priorityClassName}'
# Output: high-priority

# Check priority value
k get priorityclass high-priority -o jsonpath='{.value}'
# Output: 999999

# Cleanup
k delete ns exercise-24
k delete priorityclass high-priority
```

Alternative patch with explicit field path (if JSON patch fails):

```bash
k patch deployment critical-app --type='json' -p='[{"op": "add", "path": "/spec/template/spec/priorityClassName", "value":"high-priority"}]'
```
